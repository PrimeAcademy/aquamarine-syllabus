# Instructor Code Review

Objective: Review student code, compassionatly, as a Senior Developer would. Also, review Redux content.

## Setup
Ask groups for a voulenteer during Pizza Project, or Pick one that seems well along.
You'll need to pull down their code and get it installed, DB, etc.

## Overview
Outline to students that Code Reviews are part of the job. Some students will be uncomfortable -- it's a very normal reaction to getting feedback.
The key for students to remember is that "I am not my code."

Guidelines for a compassionate code review:
- Is it true?
- Is it necessary?
- Is it kind?

- |"Rockstar" => Mentor|

How did they handle the total in the cart?
How are they naming actions? reducers?
How are they organizing components?
