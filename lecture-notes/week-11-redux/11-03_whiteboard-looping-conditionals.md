## Find the first repeat

Prompt:

> Given a string, find the first consecutively repeating character in it and return it's index. If there are no repeating characters, return -1.

Example clarifying questions:

- Will they always be strings? Yes.
- Does capitalization matter? No. You may assume all characters are lowercase.
- Do spaces matter? No. "elite elephant" should return `-1` because there is a space between then (non-consecutive)
- May I use built in methods like `.indexof()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, `.toLowercase()`, and `.reverse()`? Yes

Example test cases:

```
"hello" -> 3
"aaaaaaaw shucks!" -> 1 
"sweet" -> 3
"radical" -> -1
"elite elephant" -> -1
```

> Interviewer Note: To complicate the problem, allow letters to match even if there is a space between them and even if one is capitalized. Example: `Elite Elephant` or `elite elephant` should return `6`

Example Solution:

```JavaScript
const findFirstRepeat = stringToCheck => {
    for (let i = 0; i < stringToCheck.length; i++) {
        if (stringToCheck[i] == stringToCheck[i+1]) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

Lessons:

- Strings can be treated like arrays in JavaScript
- String manipulation is incredibly important for whiteboard problems.

## Max Consecutive Ones

Prompt:

> Given an array of 1s and 0s, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example clarifying questions:

- Will they always be arrays of 1s and 0s as numbers? Yes.
- May I use built in methods like `.max()` or `.min()`? Yes
- Will the array always have numbers? It may be empty, if it is, return 0 (the number of 1s).

Example test cases:

```
[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] -> 1
[1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1] -> 5
[0,0,0] -> 0
[] -> 0
[1,1,1,0,1,1,1] -> 3
```

Example Solution:

```JavaScript
const countConsecutiveOnes = arrayToCheck => {
    let maxConsecutive = 0;
    let currentStreak = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arrayToCheck.length; i++) {
        if (arrayToCheck[i] == 1) {
            currentStreak++;
        } else {
            //check current against longest
            if (currentStreak > maxConsecutive) {
                maxConsecutive = currentStreak;
            }
            currentStreak = 0;
        }
    }
    return maxConsecutive;
};
```

## Compare arrays

Prompt:

> Given two arrays of strings, determine if any value from the first array is present in the second array.

Example clarifying questions:

- Will the arrays always contain strings? Yes.
- May I use `Array.includes()`? No
- Will the arrays ever be empty? Possibly, in that case return false
- Does capitalization matter? No. You may assume all characters are lowercase.

Example test cases:

```
["tacos", "pizza", "salamander"], ["potato", "orangutan", "pizza"] -> true
["tacos", "pizza", "salamander"], ["potato", "orangutan", "fluff-ball"] -> false
[], ["potato", "orangutan", "fluff-ball"] -> false
```

Example Solution:

```JavaScript
const compareArrays = (firstArray, secondArray) => {
  for (let firstArrayVal of firstArray) {
    for (let secondArrayVal of secondArray) {
      if (firstArrayVal === secondArrayVal) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```
