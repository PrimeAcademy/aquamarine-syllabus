# Week 11 - Context and Project Ideation

## For Students: Solo Projects Are Coming

Planning the solo project is a multi-week process and involves the main instructor and at least one other instructor to be effective.


## Other Cohort Solo Presentations

The cohort will attend another cohortâ€™s solo project presentations on Monday of this week.

Prep before with your cohort about what the projects are, that you are 5 short weeks away. There is work to do starting this week to be prepared to start your project.

### While They Watch

- take notes on technologies mentioned or cool things you saw
- note names of cool projects so you can ask them about it


### Review Afterward

- What were some cool tech you heard mentioned?
- Tell them to get thinking of ideas because next week we'll lean more into narrowing down ideas.
