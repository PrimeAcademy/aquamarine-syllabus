# Code Review Prep

- Update Trello Board
    - Make sure Trello Board is up to date and people know what they are tackling next
- Get application ready to present
    - Instructors will want to look at entire route from HTML to database
    - Instructors will want to see all functioning features
        - Merge all code together so it is ready and you don't need to sscramble to get it prepped before code review
        - All things to be reviewed should be in main branch on a single computer (shouldn't need to switch out computers for walkthrough)
    - Styling not required
- Job applications (start applying)
