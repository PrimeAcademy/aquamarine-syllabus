# UX Student Project Review

A 30-40 minute session where UXers are divided up between the Development groups to provide feedback or guidance on usability or key user flows. The focus is on smoothing out potentially tricky parts of the application.


## FSE Student Instructions and Prep

Before beginning, Full Stack students should be reminded that the most value can be gained through listening and they should refrain from becoming defensive or immediately justifying the decisions they have made. 

Ideas sugggested by UX are not required to be implemented, just a new way of looking at the project. Different UXers may also have varying or contradictory opinions. That’s ok, it’s important for the full stack team to listen.


### Agenda

- An explanation of the problem (without showing the product)
- UX review and feedback of current solution or parts of the solution


## Direction to UX Students (12-17-2019 Kyre)

Here are the kickoff questions we’ll ask the students to start with:

Kickoff questions:

1. What is the problem you are trying to solve for your users?
2. What is it important to know about the people that will be using the system (technical comfort level, how often they’ll use it, key goals)
3. What area(s) are most important for us to focus on from a usability perspective?

We prep our students by reminding them that the FS groups are under time pressure and responsible for actually building these systems, so to be empathetic, recognize the point in the project they are at, and focus on the pragmatic, usability-focused recommendations first.
