# Week 19 Overview

This is the last full week of develop for the group client projects. Teams should be moving into final styling and clean up as well as stretch features.


## Group Presentation Practice

This week on Wednesday or Thursday: Assign out the [group project presentation outline](/curriculum-content/supporting-documentation/group-project-presentation-outline.md)

I recommend waiting so teams don't loose focus on finishing the app. When the outline is handed out, the teams should appoint 1-2 people to working up the first draft which will be used in the first pass on Friday.

### Rehearsal Schedule

1. Friday: First rehearsal for group project presentations
2. Next Monday (Week 20 Monday): Final dress rehearsal
3. Next Tuesday (Week 20 Tuesday): Final Presentations to the School/Public
