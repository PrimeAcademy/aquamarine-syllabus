# Wireframes, Prototypes & Mockups

Wireframes are simple sketches made to describe the basic layout and flow of an application. They are often used as a starting point for designing an app, with the idea of getting something down on paper as quick as possible, and inviting feedback from colleagues and stakeholders.

Here is an example of a wireframe of youtube.com:

As you can see, there is just enough information here to indicate how this page works, without going deep into specific design choices.

## Scope Wireframes

While scoping your solo project you will draw a wireframe for each of the views your application will have. 

We will be using [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) to create wireframes. You may wish to make some quick sketches by hand first, but they must then be converted into figma wireframes.

> **NOTE:** Do _not_ create a team in figma. There is a limit to the number of pages you can make in a team design document without a paid subscription.

Some questions to help you plan your wireframes:

- What are the "nouns" or "things" in your app? Each "thing" likely needs a list view and a detail view. And possibly a create, edit, or delete view
- Every page needs navigation to every other page! Navigation should be consistent between pages. Most often, this means navigation links in a header.
- Pretend you're a user, and walk through your app click by click. What's missing? Are you able to click your way through to everything you need?

You will need a wireframe for each view of your app but you should __start with the primary views__. 

## Including Wireframes in your Scope Doc

When your wireframes are complete, you will need to [export each page as a PNG image](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040028114-Guide-to-exports-in-Figma#Export_assets_from_Figma), and embed each file into your scope document.

For each page, you will need to add descriptions to your scope document, including:

- A page title (eg. _Gallery List_)
- An overview of the page. What is it for? What does it do?
- How does the user get to the page?
- Describe all user interactions (buttons, forms, etc)
  - eg. If you click a button, what does the user see? How does it effect the data on the page? Is the user redirected to another page? 
- Who can access this page? Only logged in users? Only admin users?
- Are any of the features on this page stretch goals?


## Wireframes vs. Prototypes vs. Mockups

Generally the initial discussions of web site design results in the creation of a simple sketch of the layout. This is often a simple black and white line drawing on paper. At this phase, many changes occur to the design, and the design is usually evolving too rapidly to vest much time into details.

As more information and details of the design are discussed and determined, these wireframes are sometimes refined into a more detailed mockup that shows a clearer picture of what the site will look like. There is a lot of variety in what people consider a mockup. This can include everything from a more detailed sketch on paper to a highly detailed Photoshop image of what the final site will look like.

Mockups are also used to communicate design choices for colors. Even pencil sketch mockups will usually include information on the colors to be used for the site. Clients tend to care greatly about the color scheme selected, as it is usually is tied into branding and has a large impact on the feel of the site.

Prototypes expand on this further by making the mockup interactive and live. The basic site is developed with HTML & CSS, often using generic content such as [Lorem Ipsum text](http://www.lipsum.com/) and block placeholder images. Since this is a live website, it can illustrate interactive effects, such as scrolling images, tabbed content, or animations that could not be as easily shown on paper.

Regardless of the level of detail, it is important that the someone can look at the document immediately understand the design. The basic layout of key pieces of content and functionality should be clear even in the most basic wireframe.
