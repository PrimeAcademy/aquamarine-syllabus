# For Instructor Review

## Common Spikes

Students should be pressed to come up with something that fits the "spike" purpose and definition from above for their own project. They should think critically about this. **Do not just hand out the answer.**

Failing that, instructors should assignment them something. Common and good spike ideas and guidelines are below.

## Spike Ideas/Guidelines

- **3rd Party API**: Proof of concept/R+D, get some routes working
- **MUI/CSS library**: build out 1 (one) moderate view from your wireframes in the desired  library in a component (using JSX/MUI components)
- **Responsive CSS**: either MUI layout (paper, grid, etc) or media queries
- **Maps**: get a map with a hardcoded marker running in a React component
    - Bonus, an array of markers
    - Bonus, in a Route (not on App)
- **Charts**: get a chart working with some test data in React
- **File Upload**
    - File upload on a solo project should aim at "local" storage and DB path/url integration. If deployed on Heroku, these uploaded files will last until the Dyno is restarted. This should be fine for a solo presentation.
        1. Get file to server with `multer`
        2. Bonus: store in the cloud (AWS) using [multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3)
