# What is a Spike?
Spikes are used in Agile development management to help define and better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a plan. 

Spikes are meant to be research, coding, and analysis of whether an approach/software/theory will be viable. "Success" here is knowledge and opinion, not awesome working code.

They are meant to be outside the project, in isolation. It's not a branch per se, but a standalone bit. They are also timeboxed -- meant to only be worked on for a limited amount of time.

Think about the minimal code and set-up needed. Possibly no server, no database, maybe not even React. Think critically about keeping this minimal.


## Ideas

We will be having each of you do your own spike for your solo project.

Think about your project and what you are planning on doing -- what seems the most daunting, most unknown? What can you research and build to help make it more approachable, and known?

### Spike Examples

- If you are using an API - look into that: How it works, endpoints, features, access/auth, costs!
- New library? Get something working using that library
- Charts? Yes, see above!
- Maps? You need to get the map on the DOM playing nice with React. Google Maps, Mapbox both are good and they have React versions.
- Tricky data? Consider working out some of those tricky queries with mock or example data.

**An instructor can give you guidance or answer questions when we reivew your scope document with you.**


## Deliverable

Each spike is expected to have a demo of 2-3 minutes. The demo should reflect your learning, even if you don't get it all figured out. In fact, deciding what NOT to do or use is just as important as getting something that works perfectly.

**You are exploring something unknown, your knowledge is the goal!**

> Even if you do not get it "done" you will still be presenting. Be prepared to discuss why the approach/tech/thing isnt working and whether you intend to abandon it or try again.

The demo presentation will include you showing some sort of output (DOM, API response, e.g.) and then also talking a bit about how the code seems to be working/not working.

## In Your Scope Document

To your scope document, add an overview of your spike to the end of the file:

EXAMPLE:
```
SPIKE

Synopsis: Testing Giphy API 

Deliverable: Search API spike from a node server route

```
