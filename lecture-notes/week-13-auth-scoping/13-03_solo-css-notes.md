# Solo CSS/Styling Discussion

By this time in the program instructors tend to assume students know some CSS or how it really works. 

This is NOT true.

We are making them choose, for the first time, to support a "mobile" layout or "desktop."

**You need to as clearly as you can, describe how to plan for the CSS and styling of the Solo Project.**

## In Class

Discuss the differences amongst:

- "Native" vs web application. This project MUST be a Web Application in a Browser.
- CSS library vs Component library
    - [Some Options](https://dev.to/alexmercedcoder/ultimate-2021-list-of-css-frameworks-and-component-libraries-for-angular-react-vue-and-svelte-18p)
    - MUI is NOT required for solo projects
    - CSS lib is visual only! Easier to deal with and override
    - Component: MUI (and others) provide CSS, layout, and JS features! More complicated
    - Both may provide "responsive" support
- Mobile vs. Desktop vs. Responsive
    - Mobile - things are vertical, tables are hard, sticky navigation. Does not neccesarily need to be Responsive.
    - Desktop - things are horizontal, lots of space, tables for data work fine
    - Responsive 
        - what is it?        
        - can be done w/o a library using media queries, which are not that hard
        - many libraries do this for you. MUI does IF you use it correctly.
        - NOT REQUIRED!
