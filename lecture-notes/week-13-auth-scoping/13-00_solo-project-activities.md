# Week 13 - Scoping the Solo Project Details

## Week Overview

Flesh out the idea over the course of Mon-Thursday with the **First Draft due Thursday morning.**

## Approval Deadline and Goal

The goal is to APPROVE all student scopes by EOD next Monday - First day of Week 14. The schedule below should get you pretty close to that. Some students will go faster than others. Some will resist this process.

**The scope is a Graduation Requirement and MUST be completed to a minimumal degree. If you feel a student is not taking it seriously, tell them so. Be a hard ass. Do not do it for them.**

## Daily Activities and Assignment Schedule
Each morning, students peer review the scope work for one another.

The Review activities below are given time in class for peer review. This provides valuable feedback but also acts as a deadline for students.

- Monday: Students perform talkback activity. Students create Wireframes for homework.
- Monday: Review and Hand Out Scope Template. All work for the week should be done/end up in this document.
