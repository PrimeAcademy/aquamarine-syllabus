# Week 13 Overview

Solo project scoping and basics of Authentication and Authorization.

## Solo Project Scoping

This week is intended to introduce the concept and purpose of scoping and the solo project. Over the course of the week students will build up pieces of their solo scope and get peer feedback so that by the weekend they just need to put all of it into the Scope Template for their MVP Draft. 

- Peer feedback greatly increases quality and reduces the time instructors need for final review.
- 1 on 1s need to happen this week with students to validate and guide their scope projects (see below).
