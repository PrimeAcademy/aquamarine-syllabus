# Instructor Segues
Transitions for the setup time between groups (not necessary, just in case you're looking for inspiration). Remind the students that they should get setup while you make these transitions.

## Welcome

- Today is the culmination of 20 weeks of work
    - Explain the program (tiers, effort, time)

## Solve real world problems

- This Friday, these students will graduate, but what makes a software engineer is not a certificate, but the ability to solve real world problems with technology. Today is the proof that these students can do that.

## Group work vs Solo work

- Hollywood has the depiction of developers or hackers as lone coders in sunglasses hanging out in a basement, but in reality, development is done on teams. It's part of what makes these so challenging and so rewarding and impressive.

## Growth over the last 20 weeks

- For students coming into the program it's often hard to imagine being able to do something like this at the end of the program.
- For some students, that's the idea of creating an application like this, but for others, it's because public speaking is something that has always been challenging and intimidating.
- The soft skills growth in addition to the technical growth is part of what makes these presentations so impressive.

## Closing

- Thank you so much for coming. In 30 minutes the students who just presented will be participating in interviews in this room, so we will need to convert this room to get ready for that. Now is the perfect time to take a tour of the space. Thank you so much for coming, let's give it up one last time for _cohort name_.
