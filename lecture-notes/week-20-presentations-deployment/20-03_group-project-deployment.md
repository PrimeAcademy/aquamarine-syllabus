# Group Project Hand-off and Deployment

## Overview

Students need to prepare and hand off their code and any documentation they can to their clients. This should be a definitive end of the project. 

Hand-off should be in person (virtual call is good, too). The audience for documentation on the code itself should be targetted at a developer, not necessarily the (non-technical) client contact.
