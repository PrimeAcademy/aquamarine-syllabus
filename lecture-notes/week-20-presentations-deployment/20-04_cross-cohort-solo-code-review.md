# Peer Review of other Cohort Solo Projects

This is a scheduled time between the graduating cohort and the next FS cohort back.

## SLACK to Jr

@channel Hello! Today we’re going to practice some peer code review of the your solo projects with the Higgs cohort (who graduates tomorrow!) The goal here is to give both Higgs and Mersenne some experience in reviewing some actual code as peers, which will happen on the job all the time. We’ll go over the details at 2 pm in your classroom!

## SLACK to BOTH COHORTS

**Here's what to do:**

> This is not a chance to address or fix the current bug in your project! We want to review a flow of code that is working first!

- DM your partner(s) in Slack; start a video call
- Mersenne student will share their screen
- Pick 1 view/feature to walk through. You'll demo this from the user perspective on the UI.
    - Then you'll step through the actual CODE
    - Be sure to follow the entire flow: Component > Saga > Server > DB > response to Saga > Reducer > View
    - Ensure the endpoint/route on the server is secure and has proper authentication/authorization
- Following that, you can move on to other areas and review as you would like. Check for naming consistency, best practices, proper style.

You have the hour for this review. You do not **have** to use all of it.

Be sure to share contact and LinkedIn info! You're all Primers!
