## Wednesday & Thursday

- [Client project hand-off and deployment](./20-03_group-project-deployment.md)

## Thursday

The graduating cohort will do a peer code review of the next FS cohort back.

The goal here is to give both cohorts some experience in reviewing some actual code as peers, which will happen on the job all the time. 

They will also make a valuable contact with another Primer.

Typically groups are finishing up handing things over to their clients. These should all be done by Graduation!

If adjustable-height desks are stuck, press both the up ⬆️ and down ⬇️ buttons together for ~10 seconds, then try adjusting the height again. You may need to do this two or three times.
