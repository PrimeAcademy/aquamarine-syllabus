# Create an Employer Ready GitHub Account

In this assignment, you will be preparing your GitHub to be seen by those who are looking to hire you! You've worked incredibly hard over the weeks of the program. We want to bring the best of your work to the forefront and make it easy for employers to see what you have accomplished and what you know.

#### Example:
[Devon Mitchell - Enhydra Cohort](https://github.com/devmit92)


## Required Steps

### Left Hand Bar
The purpose of this pane is to create instant recognition of you as an individual. You are trying to humanize yourself in the eyes of the employer, becoming more than just a nameless/faceless applicant. Let's clean up your profile section of your GitHub!

- A picture is present. Picture should be the same as the one that you are using on LinkedIn. Ultimately, you want to make sure that the picture makes you recognizable come interview time. 

- List your real name. Ultimately, it should list both your `username` and Real name. If it is only listing your `username`, that means you have not set your real name. To do this, go to the upper right hand corner and click on your avatar, then select `settings`. In your settings, you can set your name.

- Also in the settings, you can write out a description. Here you would write your eventual title and company. For now, it is great if you simply put `Software Engineer`!

- List your location. Major city is just fine. No need to list suburb. Basically, 'Minneapolis, Minnesota' is great, no need to put 'Blaine, Minnesota', or 'Kansas City, Missouri' is better than 'Independence, Missouri'.

- List your email! Once again, this is about employers. Feel free to delist later when you find employment.

### Pinned
Have you ever gone to someone's GitHub and think "What should I even be looking at?" - I have. Specifically when I am looking to hire someone. I cross-checked other people who hire developers and they thought the same. The pinned area is a great area to make your best, most interesting code present and in the forefront. 

- Pin between 4 - 6 Repositories of your best work. This should certainly include your Prime Solo Project and your Group Project. Before graduation, you should also include two weekend or group challenges that are finished and were executed well. Post-graduation, these should be replaced with new work you are working on while job seeking. To select pinned repos, click on the `Customize your pins` in the upper right corner of the `Pinned` section.

- We need to see at least 4 pinned repositories that we can look at.
- If you add a description to the repo that is pinned, it will show up on the pinned page. This can be nice!

#### Note on Private Forks

Assignments that were forked from a private Prime starter repository will be *Private* unless you choose to make them public. You would need to make them *Public* if you want potential employers to see them. To make these GitHub repositories public, you will need to [duplicate the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/). (These instructions are also linked in the GitHub Settings tab, at the bottom in _Danger Zone_ for repos which are private forks.)

### Your Pinned Repository Names
Now we are going to turn your attention to the actual repos which you are show casing and clean them up!

- Your Repo name should make sense. `Student-Feedback-Form` makes much more sense than `Weekend-5-Challenge`. To change a repo name, go the the repo page. Then click on `Settings` and it will immediately bring you to the place where you can rename the repository. 

### README's
Mission critical, you need to really nail down the `README` files of the repositories for which you pinned. 

This may help as well: [Make a README site](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

- Your `README` files need to at least follow these sections:
(View Raw will give you the markdown that you can copy to your repos!)

# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed aliquam at massa in faucibus. Etiam volutpat, risus non mollis convallis, velit nisi pulvinar mi, eu faucibus orci nisi eget nibh. Integer a velit pretium, volutpat arcu eleifend, fringilla elit. Cras erat sapien, convallis venenatis tellus vitae, feugiat dictum felis.

Suspendisse euismod volutpat aliquet. Maecenas vulputate mauris in pellentesque facilisis. Phasellus varius malesuada semper. Cras sollicitudin diam mollis maximus aliquam.

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- List other prerequisites here

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
