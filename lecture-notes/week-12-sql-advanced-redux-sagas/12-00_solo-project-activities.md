# Week 12 - Choose A Project

This week students will provide a list of rough ideas they have for solo projects and get preliminary consultation from instructors on the ideas.

By the end of the week the student should be able to pitch a single idea. This idea can change over the weekend - that's fine.


## Monday

## 1 on 1s

Instructors will perform a brief (10-15 mins) one on one for each student. Likely divided up between main and support instructors.

### Meeting Objective

The goal of this 1 on 1 is to narrow down the student's solo project ideas. Come away with a definitive idea and some restrictions on making it possible. Ideally you would also have a spike in mind for them.

By the end of the week the student should be down to a single idea. This idea can change over the weekend - that's fine. But starting next week, we're going to spend time every day and homework each night on a separate aspect of our project plan, so the later the idea is changed, they'll have to do a lot of planning re-work.

Many students will feel the pressure of choosing, getting lost in the details or rabbit-holing on something they don't know how to do yet. Reassure them this will all come NEXT week during scoping. They should follow what they are most excited about (within reason).

If students are having a hard time choosing, feel free to pick for them as a last resort.

 
## Speech Topic 

"Pitch your solo project"

Tell us about your idea in 60 seconds or less. This is not a technical disseration or description, Keep it high-level, focus on the problem and the solution. Dream a little, this isn't a promise for things you will for sure build - this can be a little fluffy.
