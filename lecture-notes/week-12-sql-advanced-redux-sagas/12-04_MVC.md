# MVC


## Overview
Model–view–controller is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts.

This is done to separate information storage, how the information is displayed, and how the information changes.

The MVC design pattern allows for efficient code reuse and parallel development.

MVC as a pattern is not specific to React but is a general programming practice. Notably the C#.NET framework uses MVC. 

**model** knows things
**view** shows things
**controller** takes user input and can change the model

## React, Redux, Saga

Redux stores our Data in our reducers/store => MODEL

React renders our data in our components => VIEW

Saga controls how events progress and updates Redux => CONTROLLER
