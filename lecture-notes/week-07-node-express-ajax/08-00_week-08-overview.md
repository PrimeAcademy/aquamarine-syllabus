## 1 on 1 Topics

The goal of this 1 on 1 is to remind students about 1 on 1s, reset/reaffirm expectations they are lax on, and give space for them to say how it's going so far.

- Soft intro, remind that 1 on 1s will happen about every other week.
    - We can talk about anything
- 2nd week in class...how's it going? Leave this rather open-ended for the student to fill in
- Topics to cover
    - are you looking at your assignment feedback? try to apply the feedback, come to study groups, etc.
    - are you coding every night? we recommend at least 1 hour each night. This could be finishing your homework, reviewing the day's materials and writing down questions. Writing code is best, but any sort of work is better than nothing.

## Tech Culture Topic: Implicit Bias Tests

These discussions are managed by the Student Life team. An assignment in the Portal will be assigned out Monday of this week.
