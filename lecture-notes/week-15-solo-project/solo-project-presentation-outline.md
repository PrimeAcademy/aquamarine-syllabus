You can have slides if you like.

### Screen Hygene
- Hide Bookmarks
- Only Needed Tabs
- Clean up Desktop
- Hide/Close Devtools
    - If you need mobile, you can detach the dev tools from the browser and minimzie. [Detach Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/customize/placement/)
    - [Chrome Devtools Device Emulation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/)
- If you are uploading files, clean up the starting point to just have files you need.
- Full Screen Browser, usually.
- Monitor Zoom Level for Projector/Screen Mirror

## A/V Setup
Plug your computer into the projector HDMI -- You may need a dongle for USB-C/DVI, find which one works for you.

We want to have the projector be the same as your screen on your computer, or MIRRORED. That way you can look at your computer while demoing.

Depending on how your computer reacts, you may not need to do anything, or you may need to change the display to MIRROR on the projector.

[Apple Instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-external-displays-mchl7c7ebe08/mac#:~:text=see%20these%20options.-,On%20your%20Mac%2C%20choose%20Apple%20menu%20%3E%20System%20Preferences%2C%20click,Displays%20%2C%20then%20click%20Display%20Settings.&text=Select%20your%20display%2C%20then%20choose,from%20the%20pop%2Dup%20menu.)

Note: You must be connected to a display to see these options. This is prone to changes with differen OS versions, so things might be slightly different for you. You should only need to do this ONCE, as it remembers the settings for next time.

On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Displays , then click Display Settings.

Select the projector then choose Mirror for Display from the pop-up menu.

Open up your app in a browser, make it full screen. Check readability / zoom in if needed.

### Presentation Guide

- What problem are you solving?
    - Make the audience understand the struggle that exists today
    - Tell a story
    - Example:
        > Earlier today my brother Riley asked me to pick up some bananas from the store. I said yes, but I also remember I was supposed to pick something up for my sister Tanya. Now that I'm at the store I can't remember what it was!
- What is the solution?
    - Continue telling your story
    - Example:
        > I can never remember all of the things I was supposed to pick up for my siblings, so I created "Super Shopper." Now Riley and Tanya can add items to this list, and I don't need to worry about forgetting anything!
        
        
- Demo your app! (~2 minutes)
    - Talk through the process of what a user would do in your app. 
        -  Keep it from their perspective
            - "When a store owner logs in, they see their portfolo page with all their items!"
        -  You don't have to show EVERYTHING you built. The story is the important part.
        -  It's best to talk about WHY someone is doing something in the app, not the CAN.
            - Good: "They need to remember this for next time, so they can favorite by clicking this button... *click button* "
            - Less So: "They can favorite by clicking this button."
    - Demo Screens slower than you expect -- you know the app better than anyone, but its all new to your audience.
    - Filling out forms is error prone and less engaging. Consider making hidden buttons that autofill the forms so you can focus on the story
    - Registration is not a requried part of the demo, you only need it if it serves your story.
            
- Which technologies did you use?
    - Keep this brief. You don't have to list off everything.
    - Technologies used by many students can be mentioned quickly without explanation, or summarized.
        - Example:
            > I used React, Redux, Node, Express, and Bootstrap.

    - Technologies only a few students are familiar with or not everyone used should be given a sentence
        - Example:
            > I used the Twilio API to send text messages.
            
- What was the toughest challenge you overcame?
    - This should be a success story. This should not be a complaint or beating yourself up. Remember, this is in-part practice for describing your project to recruiters and potential employers.
    - Example:
        > The toughest challenge I overcame was synchronizing all of the lists accross multiple users so that nothing was left off the list or overwritten.
- What is the 1 (one) next thing you are excited to tackle
    - This is to build excitement around your application.
    - This is not time for you to list all of the things you wish you would have accomplished.
    - Only 1 (ONE) thing should be listed here.
    - Example:
        > Now that the synchronized list is working, the next challenge I really excited to tackle push notifications to alert my siblings that I'm about to go to the store, so they should add items to the list soon!
        
        
 - Say thanks!



## Remote Presentation Hygiene

- Make sure you have a clean zoom background
  - eg. no dirty laundry on the floor
  - Use a "virtual background" if needed
- Pay attention to your lighting
  - Try not be "backlit" by lights or windows. 
  - Use a lamp in front of you if necessary
- Close all open windows, clean up your desktop
- Look nice! Dress nice!
- Pay attention to camera framing. 
  - Your face and shoulders should take up ~70% of the screen.
- Keep your app on your laptop, not on your second monitor, so that you're looking at camera while you present.
- Don't ask "is my mike on? can you see my screen?". I will tell you if I can't hear/see you!
- Don't let chat distract you. Keep it off screen.
