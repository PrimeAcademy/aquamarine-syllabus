# Set-up Daily Development Rhythm

The day-to-day of this project for the Instructor is all about supporting, monitoring, and keeping things moving forward.

## Daily Open and Close
Follow the same process as for Solos. Remember that this time is much looser than Week 16 but you NEED to keep the cohort together - sharing and communicating wins and losses. They have built up a little support family and it must be maintained.

Plan daily start of day and end of day (EOD) check-ins with the entire cohort.

## Issues Board
Technical help or problems should be on your `cohort-syllabus` GitHub repo using Issues, just like Solo Projects. 

Be sure to clean up any open Issues left over from Solos.

## Team Slack Channels
Divide up the teams into Slack Channels. At this point you probably have "pod" channels. Feel free to re-use these or make new ones. In the end, only the student team members and any instructors should be in there. Keep team channels PUBLIC!

- **Do NOT invite Clients**. Nobody outside of Prime has access to this Slack community! The students get to have a client-free zone. Greatly discourage them to have any "chat" or instant messaging with the client. If a client is asking about this sort of thing, or being integrated into their own project management stuff, please talk to your Director. We'll likely politely decline in order to insulate the students. Recall, this is primarily an Educational project.
- Pin links at the top of this channel to:
    - GitHub repo (to check PRs)
    - Trello or other digitial task board
    - Google Scope Document


## Daily Tasks

- Check in with each team. This can be quick, this can be lengthy, up to you. But, as the Instructor, you need to be actively monitoring stress and progress.
- Monitor and resolve code Issues
- Do 1 on 1 check-ins as needed. Easy topics are teamwork/conflicts, job hunt stuff
- Be aware of job hunt ups and downs. Congratulate all things, keep things in perspective, keep Encouraging. Helps students celebrate. Encourage them to share in the main Slack channel.
