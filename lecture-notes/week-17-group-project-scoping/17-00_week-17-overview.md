# Week 17 Overview

Students will spend most of this week scoping their client projects. The scope review process is largely the same as it is for the solo project for the instructor. The applications are larger, however, so in-person/verbal feedback or review early on is very helpful.

## Instructor Expectations

There are Business things to deal with when doing these client projects. There are also Education considerations. Let's explore each, in turn.

First, Business Stuff.


## Business Stuff: Purpose of the Project

These final projects are for Clients. Clients are typically an organization who agrees to get free software development services (UX, coding, proj mgmt, consultation, etc.) from our students and staff. While they may reasonably expect completed, working software that solves their unique problem, it is not guaranteed and not Prime's focus for these engagements.

Prime offers these client projects completely free of charge (pro-bono). We do NOT guarantee any outcome whatsoever for the Client. 

In return, students are allowed to present the project as their own work and use the code for interviewing/portfolio purposes.

Our priority is the Student Experience. They get valuable work experience in consulting, scoping, planning, and executing a large team-based project for a real-world scenario. We must find a balance between producing working software and allowing the students to make mistakes and learn.

If there is a conflict between these two extremes, we will side on the Student side. We are not a working software agency.


## Business Stuff: Overview of Schedule

These projects are short. They are largely run using a general Waterfall of steps but utilizing scrum/agile methods for the day to day ebb and flow. Reprioritization occurs weekly within the team with the instructor(s) advising.

Generally speaking, our job will  be to:

1. Scope/Consult
2. Develop
3. Test
4. Document
5. Deploy
6. Hand-off

## Business Stuff: Terms and Signatures

You will need to get the client to sign off on the Scope and Pro Bono Terms. Both are explained below.

### Prime Pro Bono Project Terms

The legal/contractual agreement is bound by the Prime Pro Bono Project Terms, which is included at the end of the Scope Template. 

These terms basically release everyone from everything. Prime can deliver nothing and everything is OK. The Students can use the code in their portfolio. Students are NOT the sole owners. The Client can access/receive a copy of the code and assets.

An overview is given at the client acquisition phase and Instructors and Students do not need to worry about its content. Any questions or challenges to it should be directed to Leadership (Director of Instruction or Mark).

### Scope/Terms Signature

The student client contact should deliver the final scope. The Pro Bono Terms and Scope of Work (as produced by you and the students) are signed just once. 

- Download as PDF, send as email to client contact. Only 1 contact needs to sign that last page and return it digitally (email is best).
- Signed digital files should be uploaded to Prime's Google Drive, under: [Shared (Prime) > Pro Bono Projects > FSE project signed scopes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Lw56bB71-iFxWAFuVozJKZv7zlmjgEn)

## Scope of Work Template

The bulk of this document is the same as the Solo Project template.

- [Client Group Project Scope Document Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WuYB9f6n0EgVMp9DWK_mnHs6FqrRV1I-j49F6GfgXhw/edit)

The main differences are the Assumptions and Client Responsibilities sections. These sections are for YOU to do. See instructions below.


### Scope: Assumptions

"Assumptions" are anything that may affect the ability of the team to complete the project that is unknown. Often they are things outside of your control like assets you need from the client or a new technology you need to research. Sometimes they are parts of the process or workflow the app supports but not at part of the actual application.

The idea is that if your assumptions are known to others, and they turn out to be incorrect, it may change how much effort your project will take. They often raise questions that cannot be answered up front.

During the in-depth scope review with each team, the Instructor will document Assumptions they identify. It's possible there are none. If so, remove the entire section.

**Examples**

- 1 admin account will be set-up in the deployed system
- users will exchange money outside of this application
- Location services will need to be enabled on the device for the app to determine userâ€™s lat/longitude
- Client will supply logo artwork as png files by Feb 13, 2022
- LibraryX can calculate parsnip trajectory. Documentation suggests it is possible but is not explicit.
- Application Administrators will give new users their password verbally (outside of the app)
- The API can do such and such (if the docs are unclear). If you need something from the API but don't know for sure it has it, you are making the assumption you can get it


### Scope: Hand-off Date

In order to avoid the Graduation Week crunch, plan ahead.

Each team needs to get a tentative hand-off meeting date scheduled and put it in the Scope Document. This date will be in week 20 after presentations (usually on that Tuesday). This date may change, but we want that convo happening now, not during graduation.

_We want all projects/assets delivered to the client BY GRADUATION. This is the first step toward setting that expectation._

## Scoping Timeline

Each project is pre-scoped and vetted for feasibility by Mark (the owner) and the main instructor. These intake meetings are usually performed in Week 15 or Week 16.

Starting with the Project Kick-off, Scoping is performed largely by the students.

The scope should aim at MVP/Base functional requirements. Lean toward moving more things to Stretch. We'd rather deliver more than less. "Under promise, over deliver."


## Monday

Students will meet with their new clients (in-person or through Zoom). 

**Instructors should help kick off this meeting but leave much of the fact-finding, exploration, and question-asking to the students.**

- Monday/Tuesday - Client Kick-off Meetings [https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/group-project-kickoff](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/group-project-kickoff)

## Thursday

Scopes due to clients. This can move, but gives a fair deadline for most groups.

- Friday | Client Zoom Calls for Scope Approval | Not Created


## Speech Topics

There are typically no speeches in this week.


# TO REVIEW

- Friday | Project Management Lecture (30 mins) | Not Created
