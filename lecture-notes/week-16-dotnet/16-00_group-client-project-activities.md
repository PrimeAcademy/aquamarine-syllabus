## Group Client Project Activities for Week 16

You'll meet with clients and then present all of the projects to the students by Friday. Students get a say in which project they work on so you will need to present to them what the projects are.

Things in this doc:

1. Client intake Meetings
2. Schedule Kick-offs on Calendar
3. Present projects to the students
4. Get Student votes
5. Create Teams in Private
6. Reveal to Students
7. Communicate Next Steps

## Client intake Meetings
Typically you will be meeting your upcoming clients along with Mark. This is essentially an intake meeting where we can vet the project one more time to make sure some version of it is feasible for our students in the allotted timeframe.

Instructor should get everything out of the client that they need to write up the Project Notes (see below). Namely: who is the client, what problem are they trying to solve, what does MVP look like, and how can I "sell" this to students.


### Intake Meeting Agenda
These happen with each client, the main instructor and Mark.

Mark has sometimes already done this but either way, he will kick it off and keep it moving.

1. Introductions
2. Client problem space introduction
    - What the org does, what problem they have
3. Prioritize list of problems/features
4. Explain MVP
5. Explain scoping process
6. Next Steps - secure verbal confirmation of kick off meeting (likely next Monday)
    - Kick off: Plan 90 minutes
    - Send or bring any materials that may help explain (existing forms, spreadsheets, etc)
    - Pro bono terms overview/confirmation. This is signed during scoping.
7. Schedule Kick off on Calendar ASAP and invite the client contact(s)

### Next Steps Document
Send an email to each client with a link to this document which details the general steps, timeline, and asks them to set-up Heroku and GitHub accounts: https://www.notion.so/primedigitalacademy/Prime-Fullstack-Client-Project-Details-3bb2e959f6b44fd98bdfd86d764bf5b0

## Present Projects to Students (Friday)
The most tangible output of intake meeting is the "project notes" document that is presented to students.

It's critical to highlight what each project offers to the student. The Org mission should be pretty clear but how this project will feel to work on is insight only experience can tell.

- Call out new technologies or tech challenges (Maps, PDF downloads, etc). These should be pretty obvious.
- Less obvious are things like opportunities to do more visual design or UX work. If clients aren't giving art direction, the students certainly could. OR will they be working off of given design docs? We've done both.
- Is the client technical? This can present challenges but also opportunities to learn or meet a new mentor (or reference).

Think Big Picture, here. Think of individual skills and interest areas for students. What is different about THIS project from any of their Weekend projects or their Solo Project?

If they tackled APIs in solos, maybe they want to do something NOT APIs for this project.

## Students Pick Their Projects
Following the presentations, each student will privately give you their top 3 project preferences, in order. This allows us to create teams based on interest.

Not everyone will get their top choice. Many will get their first or second. That said, Make NO promises.

**We reserve the right to assign any student to any project for any reason.** 


## Creating Teams
Given the student preferences, you will need to create the project teams.

You will need to consider individual skill levels, interests, as well as group dynamics and project difficulty. How will the proposed team tackle the project? Can everyone contribute?

We do not assign out actual "roles" on projects. There is no Leader, no Project Manager in title. But people will likely fall into roles.

Roles you should consider filling:

- Client Contact: Looking for someone personable and responsible to be the single client contact.
- Styler: Projects present better if they look good. Consider who would carry most of the visual/CSS work on each project.
- Woot!: Who will keep things positive and upbeat?

If you have weaker technical students, who will do the heavy lifting?

You need to balance each team so the project MVP is feasible to accomplish.


## Present the Teams
Lastly, present the teams to the cohort! Do a reveal to everyone at the same time.

**MAKE IT A HUGE DEAL!**

Do not undersell it. This is the final lap of this program! Fanfare! Excitement!  Cheer!

Tell them how proud you are, how excited you are. 


## Next Steps
Get the teams organized for their kickoffs next week. Pick out the Client Contact and get them the client contact information (give them the project summary!).
