## Preparation

As an instructor, C# and .NET may be new technology for you. To prepare for this week:

- Install .NET on your machine, following the instructions in the [Explore .NET / C# Assignment](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/explore-dotnet). 
  - Try running some of the suggested katas (from codewars.com), to build some familiarity with the language.
- Review the [Explore .NET / C# Concepts](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/explore-dotnet-concepts) assignment, and make sure you have a basic understanding of each of the concepts.
- Complete the [.NET REST API Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/)
- Run through the [Entity Framework Lecture](./16-03-entity-framework.md). Make sure you understand the basics of entity framework, and can get the code running locally.

## Regular 5-Day Schedule

## Monday

Solo Project presentations and completion.

- Present solo projects
- Solo project retrospectives
- Give space/time to Deploy solo projects
  - Readmes, code clean up

### Assignment 

- [Github Cleanup](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/github-finalization-assignment/)
  - due in Week 19


### Solo Project Retros

Provide time and space for students to reflect upon their Solo Projects.

The purpose of reflecting on the Solo Project is primarily about them acknowledging how far they've come, how much they have learned, and that they can overcome challenges with the help of their team. Many students will naturally focus on things that didn't go well, or what they didn't get to.

We need them in a positive headspace to move on this week as they try to tackle a dense new language.

Here are a variety of prompts:
