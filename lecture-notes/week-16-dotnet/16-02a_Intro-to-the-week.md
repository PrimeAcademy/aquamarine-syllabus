# Learning a New Language/Tech/Framework/Library etc.

Setting up week 16, preparing for after Prime/tier 4.

## The Goal for the Week

*What are we doing?* 
We're learning  C# .NET and Entity Framework.

Our goal is to be able to create a REST API server using a new language and framework. We'll be replacing Node, Express, and PG (but not Postgres), nor anything on the Front End. Nope - React is a going to stay.

No, you will not be using .NET/C# on your client project!

*Why are we doing this? *

Most graduates from our program do not land jobs in our exact tech stack. Often, they get a new backend language. Also, with only knowing a single language (JavaScript) it is very difficult for you to speak to or compare other languages - their pros or cons. This week gives you a taste of another language so you can start to form opinions.

## Practicing for Tier 4
This week is very similar to what your life post-Prime will be. You will be asked/told/self select to learn something new. At first it will be uncomfortable, but rapidly you'll find you make progress. 

You must continue learning *and* building after you graduate. 

## How to learn things quickly
You've already got the basics down- we covered those in T1! 
Each language is different, but each has fundamental concepts like loops, variables, conditionals...

This time around, instead of learning what those are, you can ask simpler questions -- `How do I do a for loop in X` for example.

After you get the basics, you have to build things. Remember T2? Applied practice. It is NOT enough to watch videos or tutorials or read articles. 

Any of the assignments we've done could be candidates for your continued growth. Plus, this improves your Github Portfolio.

## What this week is
We'll get the basics under our feet with C# and .NET. You will write some simple Hello World/Kata programs, and then we'll make a REST API server and explore some fancier ways to work and track our Database changes. Finally we'll connect it to a DB and do a group project, much like we would have done with T2.

## What this week is not
We are going to spend a few days working in a new language (c#) a framework or two (dotnet, ef), to accomplish things you are familiar with (REST API, Database Connections)

You will not be an expert in any of these things. And that's OK!

## Takeaways from this week

- You can learn a new language/framework/library etc
- It will be hard, but you will get better with more time spent
- You should put C# .NET on your resume and in your GH
- You should apply to jobs you don't know all the tech asks
- You must keep learning and building after you graduate
