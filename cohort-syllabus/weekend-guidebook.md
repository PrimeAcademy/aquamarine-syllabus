HAVE A PLAN!

Larger projects don't just finish themselves. The Weekend Challenges at Prime are difficult and they take time to work through. You will hit errors and roadblocks and have to review the week's notes and daily assignments. Progress may be slow – likely slower than you anticipate.

Plan on this! Get started early and help each other!

**Plan to spend time on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For real. Each weekend.**


## Thursday Evening - Preview of Project:
- Read through the assignment. 
- Identify features and concepts that you are unsure about or need to see again
- Make a todo list of things you need in order to complete
- Organize this week’s assignments: much of what is on the weekend challenge was done in part on daily assignments

## Friday, In Class Review
We spend much of Fridays reviewing material either through the group project or specific activities.

- Ask clarifying questions about the assignment instructions
- Ask questions on the things you identified last night as challenge or where you still had questions
- Get started on project when time
- Whiteboarding/planning
- Project Setup, folders and files
- Feature Work
- Make a plan to connect with others in cohort over the weekend
    - In person, on campus times?
    - Online classroom times?


## Saturday, Go time
Make headway into project, commit often

If you spin on something for more than 30min, type it out into a question - this is often enough to figure it out

If you spend another 15min and can’t answer your own question, send it to the Cohort Slack, or ask it in person if applicable
TAKE BREAKS, EAT FOOD, DRINK WATER

## Sunday, crunch time

Prioritize things left to do
Base mode is priority!
- Commit Often
- TAKE BREAKS, EAT FOOD, DRINK WATER
- Make Comments on code you’re still working through understanding
- Push to Github, Turn in assignment
