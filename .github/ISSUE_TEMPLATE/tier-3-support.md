## Description

Remember...

1. Describe
2. Isolate

These bug reports are intended to help you focus on Describe and Isolate so that Fixing can happen quickly.


**Your Name**
<!-- We don't always know your github username. -->


**What do you want to happen?**

**What is actually happening?**
<!-- Include error codes if you have them. -->


## Screenshots / Code Snippets

<!-- Include a screenshot of the problem, and/or copy-paste relevant code and error messages. HINT: You can drag-and-drop images into the github editor! -->


## What did you try? Who did you ask?

<!-- Briefly describe your debug process. What did you do to narrow down the issue? -->
<!-- Remember to "bubble up" your questions. Start with google, then then your pod, and your cohort. What did you google, and what did you find? -->

## What branch is your code on? Did you git push?

<!-- Please commit and push your code to a branch, so I can check it out if needed -->

## When was the last time you took a break?

<!-- Like, a real break. Bugs have this amazing way of just dissapearing into nothingness when you take some time to clear your head. Go take a walk! -->
